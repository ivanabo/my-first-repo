# Hello Markdown!

It is **sooo** nice to be able to write in this simple format.

Once you get a hang of *it*, you just:

* Remember the basic synta
* Write your doc
* Done!

ow you can be a Wiz at this language and code up stuff like ´console.writeline("Hello Markdown!");´

Can't remember the language? No problem! Just visit one of these resources:
